Canic is a Rust toolkit for orchestrating Internet Computer (IC) canisters at scale. It packages battle‑tested patterns from large multi‑canister deployments into a reusable crate: lifecycle macros, stable‑memory helpers, orchestration ops, and endpoint bundles that keep your boundary layer thin while **encouraging clean layering** inside the canister graph.

The crate was historically known as **ICU** (Internet Computer Utilities). All core APIs have been renamed to **Canic** for the crates.io release.

## Highlights

* 🧩 **Bootstrap macros** – `canic::start!`, `canic::start_root!`, `canic::build!`, and `canic::build_root!` wire init/upgrade hooks, export endpoints, and validate config at compile time.
* 🪶 **Runtime utilities** – use `canic::api::ops::{log, perf}` for observability, `canic::cdk::types` for bounded types, and `canic::utils` for helpers.
* 🧠 **State layers** – opinionated separation for stable memory, volatile state, orchestration logic, and public endpoints.
* 🗺️ **Topology‑aware config** – typed subnet blocks, app directories, and pool policies validated straight from `canic.toml`.
* 🌿 **Linear topology sync** – targeted cascades ship a trimmed parent chain plus per‑node direct children, validate roots/cycles, and fail fast to avoid quadratic fan‑out.
* 🔐 **Auth utilities** – composable guards (`auth_require_any!`, `auth_require_all!`) for controllers, parents, whitelist principals, and more.
* 🗃️ **Stable memory ergonomics** – `ic_memory!`, `ic_memory_range!`, and `eager_static!` manage IC stable structures safely across upgrades.
* 📦 **WASM registry** – consistently ship/lookup child canister WASMs with hash tracking.
* 🪵 **Configurable logging** – ring/age retention with second‑level timestamps and paged log/query helpers; provisioning calls log caller/parent context on `create_canister_request` failures to simplify bootstrap debugging.
* ♻️ **Lifecycle helpers** – shard policies, pool capacity, scaling helpers, and sync cascades keep fleets healthy.
* 🧪 **Ready for CI** – Rust 2024 edition, toolchain pinned to Rust 1.92.0, with `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` wired via `make` targets.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install

Inside your workspace:

```bash
cargo add canic
```

Or reference the workspace path if you pulled the repository directly.

### 2. Configure `build.rs`

Every canister crate should declare a config file (default name: `canic.toml`). Use one of the provided build macros:

```rust
// Root canister build.rs
fn main() {
    canic::build_root!("../canic.toml");
}
```

```rust
// Non-root canister build.rs
fn main() {
    canic::build!("../canic.toml");
}
```

The macro validates the TOML during compilation and exposes the canonical config path via `CANIC_CONFIG_PATH`.

### 3. Bootstrap your canister

In `lib.rs`:

```rust
use canic::prelude::*;
use canic::ids::CanisterRole;

const APP: CanisterRole = CanisterRole::new("app");

canic::start!(APP); // or canic::start_root!() for the orchestrator canister

async fn canic_setup() {}
async fn canic_install(_: Option<Vec<u8>>) {}
async fn canic_upgrade() {}
```

See `crates/canisters/root` and the hub/shard reference canisters under `crates/canisters/*` for end‑to‑end patterns, including WASM registries and endpoint exports.

### 4. Define your topology

Populate `canic.toml` with subnet definitions, directory membership, and per‑canister policies. Each `[subnets.<name>]` block lists `auto_create` and `subnet_directory` canister roles, then nests `[subnets.<name>.canisters.<role>]` tables for top‑up settings plus optional sharding and scaling pools. Global tables such as `controllers`, `app_directory`, `pool` (or legacy `reserve`), `log`, and `standards` shape the overall cluster. The `[log]` block controls ring/age retention and per‑entry size caps. The full schema lives in `CONFIG.md`. The role identifiers resolve to the `CanisterRole`/`SubnetRole` wrappers in `crates/canic-core/src/ids/`.

## Layered Architecture

Canic follows a strict layered design to keep boundaries stable and refactors cheap. Dependencies must flow inward; boundary code must not depend on concrete storage representations.

* `access/` – boundary helpers (auth, guards, endpoint‑adjacent policy). These components translate requests and enforce access rules and **must not depend on concrete `model` types**.
* `model::memory` – stable data backed by `ic-stable-structures` (e.g. shard registries, pool entries).
* `model::*` (non‑memory) – volatile in‑process registries and caches that reset on upgrade (e.g. WASM registry, metrics registries).
* `ops/` – application services that bridge model to boundary code via views and projections; single‑step IC/timer façades are allowed.
* `policy/` – pure decision logic (no mutation, no IC calls).
* `workflow/` – orchestration and multi‑step behavior over time.
* `endpoints/` – macro‑generated IC entrypoints that deserialize inputs, invoke access helpers, and delegate to `workflow` or `ops`.

## Capabilities & Endpoints

### Sharding 📦

Sharding is configured via `canic.toml` and executed through the ops layer. The base endpoint bundle exposes a controller‑only registry query for operator visibility:

```rust
canic_sharding_registry()
    -> Result<canic::dto::placement::ShardingRegistryView, canic::Error>
```

### Scaling & Pool Capacity ⚖️

* `canic_scaling_registry()` provides controller insight into scaling pools via the shared endpoint bundle.
* Root canisters manage spare capacity through `canic_pool_list()` and the controller‑only `canic_pool_admin(cmd)` endpoint.

### Directory Views 📇

* `canic_app_directory(PageRequest)` returns the prime root directory view for operator dashboards.
* `canic_subnet_directory(PageRequest)` exposes the per‑subnet directory so children can discover peers.

Use `PageRequest { limit, offset }` to avoid passing raw integers into queries.

## Tooling & DX

* Format: `cargo fmt --all` (or `make fmt`)
* Fmt check: `make fmt-check`
* Check (type‑check only): `make check`
* Lint: `make clippy`
* Test: `make test`
* Build release WASMs: `make build`
* Build example targets: `cargo build -p canic --examples`

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain so CI and local builds stay in sync.

## Examples

Explore the runnable example under `crates/canic/examples/`:

* `minimal_root.rs` – bootstrap a bare‑bones orchestrator.

```bash
cargo run -p canic --example minimal_root
```

## Project Status & Contributing

Canic is the successor to the internal ICU toolkit. The repository is in the process of being opened for wider use; issues and PRs are currently limited to the core team. Follow `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the CI scripts under `scripts/ci/` for workflow expectations.
