# ✨ ICU – Internet Computer Utilities

**ICU** (Internet Computer Utilities) is a Rust framework that simplifies the development and management of multi-canister systems on the DFINITY **Internet Computer (IC)**. It provides a set of utilities and macros to coordinate multiple canisters (smart contracts) working together, making it easier to create complex canister-based dapps that scale across canister boundaries (even across multiple subnets).

ICU addresses common challenges in multi-canister architectures, including canister creation & upgrades, cross-canister state management, stable memory handling across upgrades, and establishing a clear canister hierarchy (with a **root** canister orchestrating child canisters). By using ICU, developers can focus on application logic rather than reinventing boilerplate for managing canister lifecycles and interactions.
