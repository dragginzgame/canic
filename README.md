Canic is a Rust toolkit for orchestrating Internet Computer (IC) canisters at scale. It packages the battle-tested patterns from large multi-canister deployments into a reusable crate: lifecycle macros, stable-memory helpers, orchestration ops, and endpoint bundles that keep your boundary layer thin while enforcing clean layering inside the canister graph.

The crate was historically known as **ICU** (Internet Computer Utilities). All core APIs have been renamed to **Canic** for the crates.io release.

## Highlights

- 🧩 **Bootstrap macros** – `canic::start!`, `canic::start_root!`, `canic::build!`, and `canic::build_root!` wire init/upgrade hooks, export endpoints, and validate config at compile time.
- 🪶 **Core utilities** – `canic::core` exposes perf counters, bounded types, MiniCBOR serializers, and deterministic utilities without pulling in the full ops stack.
- 🧠 **State layers** – opinionated separation for stable memory, volatile state, ops/business logic, and public endpoints.
- 🗺️ **Topology-aware config** – typed subnet blocks, app directories, and reserve policies validated straight from `canic.toml`.
- 🌿 **Linear topology sync** – targeted cascades ship a trimmed parent chain plus per-node direct children, validate roots/cycles, and fail fast to avoid quadratic fan-out.
- 🔐 **Auth utilities** – composable guards (`auth_require_any!`, `auth_require_all!`) for controllers, parents, whitelist principals, and more.
- 🗃️ **Stable memory ergonomics** – `ic_memory!`, `ic_memory_range!`, and `eager_static!` manage IC stable structures safely across upgrades.
- 📦 **WASM registry** – consistently ship/lookup child canister WASMs with hash tracking.
 - 🪵 **Configurable logging** – ring/age retention with second-level timestamps and paged log/query helpers; provisioning calls log caller/parent context on create_canister_request failures to simplify bootstrap debugging.
- ♻️ **Lifecycle helpers** – shard policies, reserve pools, scaling helpers, and sync cascades keep fleets healthy.
- 🧪 **Ready for CI** – Rust 2024 edition, MSRV 1.91, with `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` wired via `make` targets.

For canister signatures, use the ops façade (`ops::signature::prepare`/`get`/`verify`) instead of feeding raw principals into `ic-signature-verification`; `verify` builds the proper DER canister-sig public key and domain-prefixed message to avoid slice panics on short (10-byte) canister IDs. Pass the signing domain and seed from the caller rather than hardcoding them.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install

Inside your workspace:

```bash
cargo add canic
```

Or reference the workspace path if you pulled the repository directly.

### 2. Configure `build.rs`

Every canister crate should declare a config file (default name: `canic.toml`). Use one of the provided build macros:

```rust
// Root canister build.rs
fn main() {
    canic::build_root!("../canic.toml");
}
```

```rust
// Non-root canister build.rs
fn main() {
    canic::build!("../canic.toml");
}
```

The macro validates the TOML during compilation and exposes the canonical config path via `CANIC_CONFIG_PATH`.

### 3. Bootstrap your canister

In `lib.rs`:

```rust
use canic::prelude::*;
use canic::canister::EXAMPLE;

canic::start!(EXAMPLE); // or canic::start_root!() for the orchestrator canister

async fn canic_setup() {}
async fn canic_install(_: Option<Vec<u8>>) {}
async fn canic_upgrade() {}
```

See `crates/canisters/root` and the hub/shard reference canisters under `crates/canisters/*` for end-to-end patterns, including WASM registries and endpoint exports.

### 4. Define your topology

Populate `canic.toml` with subnet definitions, directory membership, and per-canister policies. Each `[subnets.<name>]` block lists `auto_create` and `subnet_directory` canister roles, then nests `[subnets.<name>.canisters.<role>]` tables for top-up settings plus optional sharding and scaling pools. Global tables such as `controllers`, `app_directory`, `reserve`, `log`, and `standards` shape the overall cluster. The `[log]` block controls ring/age retention in seconds. The full schema lives in `CONFIG.md`. The role identifiers resolve to the `CanisterRole`/`SubnetRole` wrappers in `crates/canic-core/src/ids/`.

## Layered Architecture

Canic enforces clear separation between storage, transient state, orchestration logic, and public endpoints:

- `model::memory` – stable data backed by `ic-stable-structures` (e.g. shard registries, reserve pools).
- `model::memory::state` – stable canister state/settings persisted across upgrades (e.g. `AppState`, `SubnetState`).
- `model::*` (non-memory) – volatile in-process registries/caches that reset on upgrade (e.g. WASM registry, metrics registries).
- `ops/` – business logic tying state + memory together (sharding policies, scaling flows, reserve management).
- `endpoints/` – macro-generated IC entrypoints that delegate to `ops/` and keep boundary code minimal.
- Temporary exception (target revisit in ~2 weeks): when no ops façade exists yet, read-only queries may pull directly from stable storage (`model::memory`) or runtime registries (`model::*`); mutations should still flow through `ops/`.

## Capabilities & Endpoints

### Sharding 📦

`canic::ops::ext::sharding` assigns tenants to shard canisters according to a `ShardingPolicy` (per-shard capacity and max shard count, using HRW to pick a shard). Admin work flows through a single controller-only endpoint:

```rust
canic_sharding_admin(cmd: canic::ops::ext::sharding::AdminCommand)
    -> Result<canic::ops::ext::sharding::AdminResult, canic::Error>
```

Command variants cover register, audit, drain, rebalance, and decommission flows. Your application is responsible for data migration around these moves.

### Scaling & Reserve Pools ⚖️

- `canic_scaling_registry()` provides controller insight into scaling pools via the shared endpoint bundle.
- Root canisters manage spare capacity through `canic::ops::root::reserve` and the `canic_reserve_*` endpoints.

### Directory Views 📇

- `canic_app_directory(PageRequest)` returns the prime root directory view for operator dashboards.
- `canic_subnet_directory(PageRequest)` exposes the per-subnet directory so children can discover peers.

Use `PageRequest::DEFAULT` or `PageRequest::bounded(limit, offset)` to avoid passing raw integers into queries.

### ICRC Support 📚

The base endpoint bundle includes:

- `icrc10_supported_standards()`
- `icrc21_canister_call_consent_message(request)`

Register consent messages via `model::icrc::Icrc21Registry` (or the `ops::ic::icrc` helpers) for rich UX flows.

The `Account` textual encoding matches the ICRC reference (CRC32 → base32, no padding) so checksums align with `icrc-ledger-types`; use `Display`/`FromStr` instead of hand-rolling account strings.

## Tooling & DX

- Format: `cargo fmt --all` (or `make fmt`)
- Fmt check: `make fmt-check`
- Check (type-check only): `make check`
- Lint: `make clippy`
- Test: `make test`
- Build release WASMs: `make build`
- Run the example suite: `make examples` or `cargo build -p canic --examples`

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain so CI and local builds stay in sync.

## Examples

Explore the runnable examples under `crates/canic-core/examples/`:

- `auth_rules.rs` – compose guard policies.
- `minimal_root.rs` – bootstrap a bare-bones orchestrator.
- `ops_create_canister.rs` – walk through the create-canister flow.
- `shard_lifecycle.rs` – simulate register/assign/drain/rebalance operations.

```bash
cargo run -p canic-core --example auth_rules
```

## Project Status & Contributing

Canic is the successor to the internal ICU toolkit. The repository is in the process of being opened for wider use; issues and PRs are currently limited to the core team. Follow `AGENTS.md`, `VERSIONING.md`, and `RELEASE_GUIDE.md` for workflow expectations.
