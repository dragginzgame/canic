Canic is a Rust toolkit for orchestrating Internet Computer (IC) canisters at scale. It packages the battle-tested patterns from large multi-canister deployments into a reusable crate: lifecycle macros, stable-memory helpers, orchestration ops, and endpoint bundles that keep your boundary layer thin while enforcing clean layering inside the canister graph.

The crate was historically known as **ICU** (Internet Computer Utilities). All core APIs have been renamed to **Canic** for the crates.io release; compatibility shims remain where practical so existing projects can migrate gradually.

## Highlights

- üß© **Bootstrap macros** ‚Äì `canic_start!`, `canic_start_root!`, `canic_build!`, and `canic_build_root!` wire init/upgrade hooks, export endpoints, and validate config at compile time.
- üß† **State layers** ‚Äì opinionated separation for stable memory, volatile state, ops/business logic, and public endpoints.
- üîê **Auth utilities** ‚Äì composable guards (`auth_require_any!`, `auth_require_all!`) for controllers, parents, whitelist principals, and more.
- üóÉÔ∏è **Stable memory ergonomics** ‚Äì `canic_memory!`, `canic_memory_range!`, and `canic_eager_static!` manage IC stable structures safely across upgrades.
- üì¶ **WASM registry** ‚Äì consistently ship/lookup child canister WASMs with hash tracking.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Lifecycle helpers** ‚Äì shard policies, reserve pools, delegation sessions, and sync cascades keep fleets healthy.
- üß™ **Ready for CI** ‚Äì Rust 2024 edition, MSRV 1.90, with `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` wired via `make` targets.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install

Inside your workspace:

```bash
cargo add canic
```

Or reference the workspace path if you pulled the repository directly.

### 2. Configure `build.rs`

Every canister crate should declare a config file (default name: `canic.toml`). Use one of the provided build macros:

```rust
// Root canister build.rs
fn main() {
    canic::canic_build_root!("../canic.toml");
}
```

```rust
// Non-root canister build.rs
fn main() {
    canic::canic_build!("../canic.toml");
}
```

The macro validates the TOML during compilation, emits the right `cfg` flags (e.g. `canic_capability_delegation`), and exposes the canonical config path via `CANIC_CONFIG_PATH`.

### 3. Bootstrap your canister

In `lib.rs`:

```rust
use canic::prelude::*;
use canic::canister::EXAMPLE;

canic_start!(EXAMPLE); // or canic_start_root!() for the orchestrator canister

async fn canic_setup() {}
async fn canic_install(_: Option<Vec<u8>>) {}
async fn canic_upgrade() {}
```

See `crates/canisters/root` and `crates/canisters/example` for end-to-end patterns, including WASM registries and endpoint exports.

### 4. Define your topology

Populate `canic.toml` with canister metadata, capabilities, and auth lists. The schema is documented in `CONFIG.md`.

## Layered Architecture

Canic enforces clear separation between storage, transient state, orchestration logic, and public endpoints:

- `memory/` ‚Äì stable data backed by `ic-stable-structures` (e.g. shard registries, reserve pools).
- `state/` ‚Äì volatile caches and session stores that reset on upgrade.
- `ops/` ‚Äì business logic tying state + memory together (sharding policies, delegation flows, reserve management).
- `endpoints/` ‚Äì macro-generated IC entrypoints that delegate to `ops/` and keep boundary code minimal.

Endpoints must call into `ops/`; they should never touch `memory/` or `state/` directly.

## Capabilities & Endpoints

### Delegation Sessions üîë

Enabled via `delegation = true` in `canic.toml`. When active, `canic_endpoints_delegation!()` (included automatically) exports:

- `icu_delegation_register(args)` ‚Äì register a session for the caller wallet (update).
- `icu_delegation_track(session_pid)` ‚Äì record a requesting canister (update).
- `icu_delegation_get(session_pid)` ‚Äì fetch session metadata (query).
- `icu_delegation_list_all()` / `icu_delegation_list_by_wallet(pid)` ‚Äì controller-only admin views.
- `icu_delegation_revoke(pid)` ‚Äì parent-or-self revocation (update).

Sessions auto-clean during registrations; no manual cleanup endpoint is exposed.

### Sharding üì¶

`canic::ops::shard` assigns tenants to shard canisters according to a `ShardPolicy` (initial capacity, max shards, growth thresholds). Admin work flows through a single controller-only endpoint:

```rust
icu_sharding_admin(cmd: canic::ops::sharding::AdminCommand)
    -> Result<canic::ops::sharding::AdminResult, canic::Error>
```

Command variants cover register, audit, drain, rebalance, and decommission flows. Your application is responsible for data migration around these moves.

### Scaling & Reserve Pools ‚öñÔ∏è

- `canic_endpoints_scaling!()` exposes `icu_scaling_registry()` for controller insight.
- Root canisters manage spare capacity through `canic::ops::reserve` and the `icu_reserve_*` endpoints.

### ICRC Support üìö

The base endpoint bundle includes:

- `icrc10_supported_standards()`
- `icrc21_canister_call_consent_message(request)`

Register consent messages via `state::icrc::Icrc21Registry` for rich UX flows.

## Tooling & DX

- Format: `cargo fmt --all`
- Lint: `make clippy`
- Test: `make test`
- Build release WASMs: `make build`
- Run the example suite: `make examples` or `cargo build -p canic --examples`

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain so CI and local builds stay in sync.

## Examples

Explore the runnable examples under `crates/canic/examples/`:

- `auth_rules.rs` ‚Äì compose guard policies.
- `minimal_root.rs` ‚Äì bootstrap a bare-bones orchestrator.
- `ops_create_canister.rs` ‚Äì walk through the create-canister flow.
- `shard_lifecycle.rs` ‚Äì simulate register/assign/drain/rebalance operations.

```bash
cargo run -p canic --example auth_rules
```

## Project Status & Contributing

Canic is the successor to the internal ICU toolkit. The repository is in the process of being opened for wider use; issues and PRs are currently limited to the core team. Follow `AGENTS.md`, `VERSIONING.md`, and `RELEASE_GUIDE.md` for workflow expectations.
