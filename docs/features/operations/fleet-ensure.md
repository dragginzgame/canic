# Fleet Ensure

`canic fleet ensure <fleet>` is the sole maintained Fleet installation and
convergence workflow. It reads one current desired-state document, observes the
configured controlled estate, and either writes a reviewed plan or applies the
exact retained plan digest.

> Development status: canister/code/controller/cycle convergence and the typed
> Store, Registry, Root-mirror, local Component Registry and Component action
> graph are implemented. A fresh-estate governed PocketIC journey traverses the
> complete graph through catalog publication and immediately recompiles with no
> update effect. Authority-bearing operator commands now consume the same
> terminal inventory and exact protocol bindings. That inventory is rebuilt
> from terminal protected control-plane evidence, including protocol-created
> Components, pool assets and bounded descendants. Focused implementation
> qualification is complete; broad validation remains maintainer-owned.

## Desired State

The default document is `fleets/<fleet>.toml`:

```toml
schema_version = 1
fleet = "staging"
environment = "local"
treasury = "<controlled-treasury-principal>"
operator = "<operator-principal>"
cycles_ledger = "<cycles-ledger-principal>"
ledger_fee_cycles = "100000000"
management_creation_fee_cycles = "500000000000"
material_cycle_threshold = "1000000"
maximum_observation_burn_cycles = "10000000"
maximum_update_burn_cycles = "100000000000"
maximum_stalled_observations = 8

[protocol]
app_config = "canic.toml"
coordinator_candid = "artifacts/fleet_coordinator.did"
root_candid = "artifacts/fleet_subnet_root.did"
store_candid = "artifacts/wasm_store.did"
[[protocol.component_group_placements]]
deployment = "primary_cells"
ordinal = 0
root = "root"

[[canisters]]
name = "treasury"
kind = "auxiliary"
presence = "present"
principal = "<controlled-treasury-principal>"
replace = false
subnet = "<subnet-principal>"
controllers = ["<operator-principal>"]
initial_cycles = "0"
minimum_cycles = "0"

[[canisters]]
name = "coordinator"
kind = "coordinator"
presence = "present"
replace = false
subnet = "<subnet-principal>"
controllers = ["<operator-principal>"]
initial_cycles = "5000000000000"
minimum_cycles = "1000000000000"
wasm = "artifacts/fleet_coordinator.wasm"
```

The optional `[protocol]` block enables Canic-owned control-plane
choreography. It names only the checked-in App configuration, exact
Coordinator/Root/Store Candid contracts, and typed deployment placements.
Operators do not provide Candid methods, argument documents or expected
response bytes. Canic compiles Store artifact staging/bootstrap, deterministic
Registry joins, Root synchronization, Registry and Root-mirror activation, and
exact local Component Registry preparation before Component provisioning in
that order. Every configured initial placement must appear once and every
selected Root must be a declared Root role.

All cycle quantities are exact decimal strings. Unknown fields and unknown
schema generations reject. Wasm, binary init-argument, and drain-Candid files
are hashed into the reviewed plan and rechecked immediately before their
effect. Fleet/environment labels are path-safe before Canic accesses operator
state. Authority Principals must be valid and non-anonymous. The configured
treasury must already be present and is always reused, never replaced. The
active ICP identity must equal `operator`, and every present
canister retains that Principal as a direct controller so interrupted effects
remain observable and resumable. A Store additionally retains its exact owning
Root as a direct controller; Root adoption records policy ownership without
removing the protected operator.

## Plan And Apply

Planning performs observation and local current-state writes but no paid Fleet
mutation:

```bash
canic fleet ensure staging --desired fleets/staging.toml
```

Review the printed canister dispositions and conservation bounds, then apply
the exact digest:

```bash
canic fleet ensure staging \
  --desired fleets/staging.toml \
  --apply <plan_sha256>
```

If desired bytes, artifacts, authority-bearing live state, funding sufficiency,
the live Cycles Ledger fee, or bounded cycle observations changed, apply stops
before effects and requires a new plan.
If an accepted effect produces less live state than reviewed, Canic closes that
completed action journal, refuses to call the Fleet converged, and requires a
new plan from the resulting live estate; it never guesses a compensating debit.
Any newly created Principal remains retained as pending current authority, so
the successor plan reuses that canister instead of issuing another creation.
An interrupted invocation retains one intent per action under
`.canic/fleet-ensure/<environment>/<fleet>/` and resumes that action before
opening another. The stall budget counts only consecutive non-progress.

## Cycle Conservation

The reviewed maximum equation is:

```text
observed controlled cycles
+ maximum operator debit
- maximum unavoidable fees
- maximum observation and update burn
= expected minimum post-operation cycles
```

Terminal evidence uses measured values:

```text
observed starting cycles
+ received new funding
- measured execution and observation burn
= final controlled cycles
```

After protocol convergence, Canic rebuilds the terminal inventory from the
exact active Coordinator Registry, retained Root provisioning result, protected
Component Registry partitions, Root pool pages and bounded sharding-child
pages. Every discovered Principal must retain the exact current authority,
parent, role, Candid profile and module hash before its live balance enters the
conservation equation. This prevents a no-effect successor plan from forgetting
protocol-created Components, descendants or unused pool assets.

Creation funding, Cycles Ledger fees, management creation fees, update burn,
observation burn, and retirement transfers are separate report fields. Apply
cannot issue actions whose planned debit exceeds the reviewed operator bound;
terminal success additionally requires measured burn to remain within its
reviewed ceiling.

## Retirement Boundary

An IC controller cannot pull cycles from an arbitrary canister. A material
source must therefore declare an idempotent, controller-authorized drain
endpoint before replacement or deletion:

```toml
[canisters.drain]
candid = "interfaces/cycle-drain.did"
method = "canic_cycle_drain"
destination = "<controlled-treasury-principal>"
maximum_execution_burn_cycles = "100000000"
```

The endpoint receives the Fleet operation ID, exact destination, and exact
cycle amount and must return either `Accepted` or `Replayed` with that same
amount. A missing, changed, foreign, or unsafe drain returns a typed blocker.
The source response is issuance evidence only. Canic retains the exact source
and treasury balances from before the call, then proves both the bounded source
debit and the exact controlled-treasury credit from fresh live observations.
Canic leaves the canister running and funded if either side is absent,
inconsistent, or ambiguous. Stop and delete occur only after that two-sided
proof and a fresh stopped/balance check.

The same rule applies to Canic control-plane updates: a successful update call
marks the command issued, not applied. The journal advances only after the
exact typed status query proves terminal state; consecutive unchanged status
observations consume the stall budget and genuine progress resets it.

## Hard-Cut Boundary

The reconciler does not read or migrate former install plans, role journals,
repair receipts, recovery bundles, installed-Fleet caches, or version-pair
contracts. Historical release notes remain evidence only. Current desired
state, current `v1` ensure state, and current live observations are the only
host authorities.
