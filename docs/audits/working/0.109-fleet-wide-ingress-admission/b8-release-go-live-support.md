This evidence closes the in-repository correction portion of B8. It does not
close B8 itself: the immutable matching package release and separately
authorized downstream adoption/qualification remain human-owned prerequisites.

## `CANIC-109-GOLIVE-001`: fresh pool capacity

Root Component-batch acceptance no longer rejects a fresh installation solely
because the Ready pool is empty. After validating the exact Coordinator,
Registry mirror, compiled batch, Root Store and artifacts, the workflow runs
one bounded pass of the existing Root-owned Canister-pool maintenance journal.
It then revalidates the same Registry acceptance authority before retaining the
batch. If capacity is still not Ready, the existing Coordinator retry resumes
the same durable operation and the next pass advances the same Root journal.

This creates no host-side pool seeder, timer, creation journal or alternate
Ledger owner. IC-profile creation continues through the production
Cycles-Ledger operation identity, cost guard, pending creation record and
reset-to-Ready lifecycle. The Root's existing asynchronous lease prevents a
timer, manual command and Coordinator-driven pass from overlapping.

The production-shaped PocketIC proof begins with zero imported pool assets.
The Cycles Ledger stub returns one exact pre-created canister under the Root;
the Root issues one Ledger request, adopts and resets that canister, accepts
the batch and provisions the configured Component. While the Root-owned
provisioning journal is still advancing, protected Coordinator status exposes
the exact Root, `RootProvisioning` stage, registered `STATE_CONFLICT` code and
nonzero failure timestamp. Terminal provisioning clears the pending failure
projection.

A separate local-profile journey uses the same high-level Coordinator
`ProvisionComponents` command and Root journals with Root-owned Ready capacity.
It publishes the initial Fleet-service successor at Registry revision 4 and
reaches `RuntimesActivated` with one terminal Root receipt. This separates the
IC Cycles-Ledger proof from the local runtime activation proof instead of
faking NNS-dependent IC activation in a minimal PocketIC topology.

## `CANIC-109-GOLIVE-002`: monotonic Registry successor recovery

Host restart still accepts the exact retained all-Active Registry without any
successor exception. When live Registry state differs, the host recompiles the
exact fresh Component-provisioning plan from the immutable install plan,
configuration and retained all-Active predecessor. It queries the exact
installed Coordinator's protected operation status and accepts only a live
Registry that:

- is canonical under the protected topology and its own manifest/version;
- advances the predecessor by exactly one revision;
- preserves the exact Fleet authority, Component Specs and Root entries;
- is the first nonempty service publication from an empty-service predecessor;
- is bound to the deterministic install operation ID and compiled plan hash;
- names the exact predecessor and live published Registry versions; and
- retains a fresh-install phase at or after `ServiceTopologyPublished`.

Focused tests retain exact-predecessor success and exact-successor success, and
reject missing Coordinator evidence, pre-publication evidence, a substituted
plan hash and a later Registry revision. The existing activation journal tests
continue to reject changed source or response authority and recover one exact
atomic activation result.

## `CANIC-109-GOLIVE-003`: typed retry evidence

The Coordinator provisioning record now retains at most one typed Root retry
failure: exact Root Principal, closed retry stage, registered compact
diagnostic code and failure timestamp. The scheduled workflow records that
value before rescheduling a failed Root step. Status projects it only when it
matches the current durable in-flight Root/stage and follows that intent's
start time. Later progress cannot expose a stale failure as current, and the
terminal compact scale-out receipt contains none.

Stable validation binds every retained failure to a Root in the exact plan,
rejects zero diagnostics and regressed timestamps, and preserves the record
across same-release restart. The canonical Coordinator Candid contains the
closed four-stage enum, bounded failure record and optional protected status
field. No log text becomes a protocol or replay authority.

The broader Coordinator filter initially found a test-only terminal admission
fixture with an arbitrary nonzero Root receipt hash. The fixture now derives
the exact operation/policy/catalog-bound receipt and the complete 44-test
filter passes. The governed fast tier then caught its stale 25-case inventory
expectation before PocketIC; the exact current inventory is 30. Warning-denied
Clippy found and closed current-0.109 cfg, pattern, future-size and explicit
long-proof annotations without weakening runtime authority.

The complete maintainer validation gate was not run. Repository policy reserves
that gate for the maintainer-owned release flow. No Toko source or dependency
was changed, no downstream qualification was run, and no canister, Ledger,
CMC, network, funding, version, Git or publication effect occurred.

## Result

The in-repository B8 corrections are ready for the maintainer-owned complete
validation/version/publication workflow. B8 remains open until the exact
published package pair is adopted and separately qualified downstream with no
unresolved Canic-owned blocker. B9 and 0.110 remain blocked.
