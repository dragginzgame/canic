# Audit: Canonical Auth Boundary Invariant

## Purpose

Ensure every authenticated request enters through one canonical verification boundary.

## Risk Model / Invariant

All authenticated execution paths must pass through the canonical authentication verifier before authorization or handler logic executes.

No alternate entrypoint may perform partial or weaker authentication.

The canonical boundary must perform or invoke verification stages for:

- token signature validation
- trust-chain validation
- subject-caller binding
- freshness / expiry verification

## Why This Matters

Auth fragmentation creates bypass risk when internal helpers, macros, or special endpoints apply weaker checks.

## Canonical Authentication Pipeline

The canonical authentication pipeline must follow this structure:

`token verification -> subject binding -> authorization -> handler execution`

## Relationship to Other Invariants

This invariant verifies that all authenticated execution paths converge on the canonical authentication verifier.

Other invariants verify the correctness of individual verification stages:

- Token Trust Chain Invariant
- Subject-Caller Binding Invariant
- Audience Target Binding Invariant
- Expiry / Replay / Single-Use Invariant

## Run This Audit After

- endpoint or dispatcher changes
- macro / DSL auth wiring changes
- internal/admin endpoint additions
- migration or recovery auth-flow updates

## Report Preamble (Required)

Every report generated from this audit must include:

- Scope
- Compared baseline report path
- Code snapshot identifier
- Method tag/version
- Comparability status

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Map Entrypoints

Identify all authenticated start points:

- public update/query endpoints
- dispatcher helpers
- internal/admin service endpoints
- migration/recovery entrypoints
- macro-generated authenticated handlers

### 2. Verify Convergence

Search terms:

```text
authenticated(
delegated_token_verified
verify_token
require_auth
admin_
internal_
system_
```

Confirm:

- all authenticated paths call the canonical verifier directly, or through a thin wrapper that does not alter verification semantics
- no special-case endpoint duplicates weaker auth logic
- no internal-only path assumes prior verification without proof

### 3. Verify Ordering

Confirm canonical stage ordering:

`token verification -> subject binding -> authorization -> handler execution`

### 4. Verify Non-Production Paths

Confirm debug, migration, test-only, and feature-flagged code cannot weaken production auth behavior.

### 5. Test Expectations

- integration test for canonical dispatcher flow
- regression test proving alternate entrypoints cannot bypass verifier

## Structural Hotspots

List concrete files/modules/structs that carry boundary convergence risk.

Detection commands (run and record output references):

```bash
rg '^use ' crates/ -g '*.rs'
rg 'crate::workflow|crate::ops|crate::api|crate::policy' crates/ -g '*.rs'
rg 'pub struct|impl ' crates/ -g '*.rs'
git log --name-only -n 20 -- crates/
```

| File / Module | Struct / Function | Reason | Risk Contribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `access/expr.rs` | `eval_access` | central auth dispatch boundary | High |
| `access/auth.rs` | `delegated_token_verified`, `verify_token` | canonical verification path | High |
| `canic-dsl-macros/src/endpoint/expand.rs` | access expansion block | macro entrypoint convergence wiring | Medium |

If none are detected in a given run, state: No structural hotspots detected in this run.

## Hub Module Pressure

Detect modules trending toward gravity-well behavior from import fan-in, cross-layer coupling, and edit frequency.

| Module | Import Tokens | Unique Subsystems | Cross-Layer Count | Pressure Score |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `<module>` | `<top import tokens>` | `<n>` | `<n>` | `<1-10>` |

Pressure score guidance:

- 1-3 = low
- 4-6 = moderate
- 7-10 = high

## Red Flags

- duplicated auth logic in endpoint-local code
- internal/admin bypasses around canonical verifier
- ordering drift where authorization can execute before identity binding
- endpoint performs authorization without calling canonical verifier
- internal service path trusts upstream verification without proof

## Severity

High to Critical depending on bypass scope.

## Early Warning Signals

Detect predictive architecture-decay patterns before they appear as friction or failures.

Detection scans (run and record output references):

```bash
rg 'enum ' crates/ -g '*.rs'
rg 'pub struct|pub fn' crates/ -g '*.rs'
rg '^use ' crates/ -g '*.rs'
git log --name-only -n 20 -- crates/
```

| Signal | Location | Evidence | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<signal>` | `<path or module>` | `<scan evidence>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |
| `dependency fan-in hub` | `<module path>` | `imported by <n> files across <subsystems>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

### Enum Shock Radius

| Enum | Defined In | Reference Files | Risk |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `<EnumName>` | `<path>` | `<count>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

Thresholds:

- `0-5` references = normal
- `6-10` = coupling forming
- `10+` = architectural shock radius

### Cross-Layer Struct Spread

| Struct | Defined In | Layers Referencing | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<StructName>` | `<path>` | `<api/workflow/ops/policy>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

### Growing Hub Modules

| Module | Subsystems Imported | Recent Commits | Risk |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `<path>` | `<subsystems>` | `<count>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

### Capability Surface Growth

| Module | Public Items | Risk |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `<path>` | `<count pub fn + pub struct>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

Thresholds:

- `0-10` = normal
- `10-20` = growing surface
- `20+` = risk

If no predictive signals are detected, state: No predictive architectural signals detected in this run.

## Dependency Fan-In Pressure

Detect modules and structs becoming architectural gravity wells before friction increases.

Detection scans (run and record output references):

```bash
rg "use crate::" crates/ -g "*.rs"
rg "pub struct" crates/ -g "*.rs"
# then: rg "<StructName>" crates/ -g "*.rs"
```

### Module Fan-In

Count how many files import each module; flag modules imported by `6+` files.

| Module | Import Count | Subsystems Referencing | Pressure Level |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `<module path>` | `<count>` | `<api/workflow/ops/policy/...>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

Pressure level rules:

- `0-3` imports = normal
- `4-6` imports = rising pressure
- `7-10` imports = hub forming
- `10+` imports = architectural gravity well

### Struct Fan-In

Count references for public structs; flag structs referenced in `6+` files.

| Struct | Defined In | Reference Count | Risk |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `<StructName>` | `<path>` | `<count>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

Interpretation:

- `6-8` references = coupling forming
- `9-12` = hub abstraction
- `12+` = system dependency center

If no modules exceed the fan-in threshold, state: No fan-in pressure detected in this run.

## Risk Score

Risk Score: **X / 10**

Interpretation scale:

- 0-2 = negligible risk
- 3-4 = low risk
- 5-6 = moderate risk
- 7-8 = high risk
- 9-10 = critical architectural risk

Score must be justified using checklist findings and Structural Hotspots evidence.

Derivation guidance (deterministic):

- start at `0`
- add `+4` for any confirmed boundary bypass
- add `+2` per medium/high hotspot contribution (max `+4`)
- add `+2` if any hub module pressure score is `>= 7`
- add `+1` if enum shock radius is detected (`> 6` reference files)
- add `+1` if cross-layer struct spread is detected (`>= 3` architecture layers)
- add `+2` if growing hub module signal is detected
- add `+1` if capability public surface is `> 20` items
- add `+1` for fan-in `6-8` across multiple subsystems
- add `+2` for fan-in `9-12` across multiple subsystems
- add `+3` for fan-in `12+` across multiple subsystems
- clamp to `0..10`

If no confirmed findings and no hotspot/hub signals are present, score must remain `0-2`.

## Verification Readout

Use command outcomes with normalized statuses:

- `PASS`
- `FAIL`
- `BLOCKED`

## Follow-up Actions

If result is `FAIL`/`PARTIAL` or risk score is `>= 5`, include owner, action, and target report run.

If no action is needed, state: `No follow-up actions required.`
