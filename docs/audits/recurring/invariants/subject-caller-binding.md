# Audit: Subject-Caller Binding Invariant

## Purpose

Ensure delegated tokens cannot be used as transferable bearer credentials.

## Risk Model / Invariant

A delegated token must be rejected unless:

`token.claims.sub == ic_cdk::caller()`

Authentication must enforce this before authorization, business logic, or state mutation.

## Why This Matters

This invariant preserves proof-of-possession semantics. If it breaks, a stolen token can impersonate another principal.

## Required Ordering

Subject-caller binding must occur after token verification and before authorization or handler execution.

`verify token -> bind subject to caller -> authorize scope -> execute handler`

## Run This Audit After

- auth refactors
- access-layer changes
- token DTO changes
- root / shard signing changes
- macro / DSL changes
- runtime changes affecting caller identity

## Report Preamble (Required)

Every report generated from this audit must include:

- Scope
- Compared baseline report path
- Code snapshot identifier
- Method tag/version
- Comparability status

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Canonical Enforcement

Search terms:

```text
claims.sub
sub == caller
delegated_token_verified
authenticated(
```

Confirm:

- one canonical enforcement point exists
- subject-caller binding is enforced by the canonical authentication verifier before authorization or handler logic executes
- subject binding occurs before scope authorization
- subject binding occurs before business logic
- no alternate path skips the check

### 2. No Bearer Fallback Paths

Search terms:

```text
AuthenticatedRequest
presenter_pid
relay
envelope
```

Confirm:

- no relay model exists in production auth flow
- no authentication path accepts token proof without binding token subject to runtime caller
- no path verifies token proof while ignoring caller identity
- no legacy bypass path survives in production code

### 3. No Ignored Caller Inputs

Search terms:

```text
fn authenticated(_caller
fn delegated_token_verified(_caller
```

Confirm:

- `_caller` is not ignored in canonical verification paths
- caller identity is compared against token subject
- no unused caller parameter exists in canonical auth code
- no verification function receives caller identity and fails to compare it against token subject

### 4. Macro / DSL Preservation

For abstractions such as `authenticated(...)` and `requires_scope(...)`, confirm macro/DSL expansion ultimately routes through the canonical verifier and does not bypass subject-caller binding.

### 5. Test Expectations

Must include at least one canonical dispatcher test proving:

`token for user A + caller B => rejection`

`token for user A + caller A => success`

## Structural Hotspots

List concrete files/modules/structs that carry subject-binding risk.

Detection commands (run and record output references):

```bash
rg '^use ' crates/ -g '*.rs'
rg 'crate::workflow|crate::ops|crate::api|crate::policy' crates/ -g '*.rs'
rg 'pub struct|impl ' crates/ -g '*.rs'
git log --name-only -n 20 -- crates/
```

| File / Module | Struct / Function | Reason | Risk Contribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `access/auth.rs` | `verify_token`, `enforce_subject_binding` | canonical subject-caller check location | High |
| `access/expr.rs` | `eval_access` | dispatch entrypoint into auth predicates | Medium |
| `canic-dsl-macros/src/endpoint/expand.rs` | endpoint expansion wiring | abstraction path into canonical verifier | Medium |

If none are detected in a given run, state: No structural hotspots detected in this run.

## Hub Module Pressure

Detect modules trending toward gravity-well behavior from import fan-in, cross-layer coupling, and edit frequency.

| Module | Import Tokens | Unique Subsystems | Cross-Layer Count | Pressure Score |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `<module>` | `<top import tokens>` | `<n>` | `<n>` | `<1-10>` |

Pressure score guidance:

- 1-3 = low
- 4-6 = moderate
- 7-10 = high

## Red Flags

- signature verification succeeds without subject comparison
- handler-local auth checks replace canonical binding
- conditional logic skips binding for specific endpoints
- comments imply caller identity is trusted by convention

## Severity

Critical: enables cross-principal impersonation.

## Early Warning Signals

Detect predictive architecture-decay patterns before they appear as friction or failures.

Detection scans (run and record output references):

```bash
rg 'enum ' crates/ -g '*.rs'
rg 'pub struct|pub fn' crates/ -g '*.rs'
rg '^use ' crates/ -g '*.rs'
git log --name-only -n 20 -- crates/
```

| Signal | Location | Evidence | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<signal>` | `<path or module>` | `<scan evidence>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |
| `dependency fan-in hub` | `<module path>` | `imported by <n> files across <subsystems>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

### Enum Shock Radius

| Enum | Defined In | Reference Files | Risk |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `<EnumName>` | `<path>` | `<count>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

Thresholds:

- `0-5` references = normal
- `6-10` = coupling forming
- `10+` = architectural shock radius

### Cross-Layer Struct Spread

| Struct | Defined In | Layers Referencing | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<StructName>` | `<path>` | `<api/workflow/ops/policy>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

### Growing Hub Modules

| Module | Subsystems Imported | Recent Commits | Risk |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `<path>` | `<subsystems>` | `<count>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

### Capability Surface Growth

| Module | Public Items | Risk |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `<path>` | `<count pub fn + pub struct>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

Thresholds:

- `0-10` = normal
- `10-20` = growing surface
- `20+` = risk

If no predictive signals are detected, state: No predictive architectural signals detected in this run.

## Dependency Fan-In Pressure

Detect modules and structs becoming architectural gravity wells before friction increases.

Detection scans (run and record output references):

```bash
rg "use crate::" crates/ -g "*.rs"
rg "pub struct" crates/ -g "*.rs"
# then: rg "<StructName>" crates/ -g "*.rs"
```

### Module Fan-In

Count how many files import each module; flag modules imported by `6+` files.

| Module | Import Count | Subsystems Referencing | Pressure Level |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `<module path>` | `<count>` | `<api/workflow/ops/policy/...>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

Pressure level rules:

- `0-3` imports = normal
- `4-6` imports = rising pressure
- `7-10` imports = hub forming
- `10+` imports = architectural gravity well

### Struct Fan-In

Count references for public structs; flag structs referenced in `6+` files.

| Struct | Defined In | Reference Count | Risk |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `<StructName>` | `<path>` | `<count>` | `<Low/Medium/High>` |

Interpretation:

- `6-8` references = coupling forming
- `9-12` = hub abstraction
- `12+` = system dependency center

If no modules exceed the fan-in threshold, state: No fan-in pressure detected in this run.

## Risk Score

Risk Score: **X / 10**

Interpretation scale:

- 0-2 = negligible risk
- 3-4 = low risk
- 5-6 = moderate risk
- 7-8 = high risk
- 9-10 = critical architectural risk

Score must be justified using checklist findings and Structural Hotspots evidence.

Derivation guidance (deterministic):

- start at `0`
- add `+4` for any confirmed invariant break
- add `+2` per medium/high hotspot contribution (max `+4`)
- add `+2` if any hub module pressure score is `>= 7`
- add `+1` if enum shock radius is detected (`> 6` reference files)
- add `+1` if cross-layer struct spread is detected (`>= 3` architecture layers)
- add `+2` if growing hub module signal is detected
- add `+1` if capability public surface is `> 20` items
- add `+1` for fan-in `6-8` across multiple subsystems
- add `+2` for fan-in `9-12` across multiple subsystems
- add `+3` for fan-in `12+` across multiple subsystems
- clamp to `0..10`

If no confirmed findings and no hotspot/hub signals are present, score must remain `0-2`.

## Verification Readout

Use command outcomes with normalized statuses:

- `PASS`
- `FAIL`
- `BLOCKED`

## Follow-up Actions

If result is `FAIL`/`PARTIAL` or risk score is `>= 5`, include owner, action, and target report run.

If no action is needed, state: `No follow-up actions required.`
