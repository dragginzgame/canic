# Wasm Footprint Audit - 2026-03-28

## Report Preamble

- Scope: Canic wasm footprint
- Definition path: `docs/audits/recurring/system/wasm-footprint.md`
- Compared baseline report path: `N/A`
- Code snapshot identifier: `c6fdb0b2`
- Method tag/version: `Method V1`
- Comparability status: `comparable`
- Auditor: `codex`
- Run timestamp (UTC): `2026-03-28T13:39:20Z`
- Branch: `main`
- Worktree: `dirty`
- Profile: `wasm-release`
- Target canisters in scope: `root` 
- Analysis artifact note: `twiggy` ran against cached raw Cargo wasm to preserve readable symbol names; built/shrunk byte metrics still use the canonical built and `dfx`-shrunk artifacts.

## Findings / Checklist

| Check | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wasm artifacts captured for scope | PASS | Cached raw artifacts under `artifacts/wasm-size/wasm-release/raw/` and shrunk artifacts under `artifacts/wasm-size/wasm-release/shrunk/` were recorded for `root` . |
| Artifact sizes recorded in machine-readable artifact | PASS | [size-report.json](artifacts/wasm-footprint/size-report.json) and [size-metrics.tsv](artifacts/wasm-footprint/size-metrics.tsv) retain aggregate and baseline data. |
| Twiggy top analyzed | PASS | Offender and retained-size summaries remain in the per-canister detail reports; raw output was later pruned. |
| Twiggy dominators analyzed | PASS | Retained-size ownership was summarized in the report; raw output was later pruned. |
| Twiggy monos analyzed | PASS | Generic-bloat evidence was summarized in the report; raw output was later pruned. |
| Baseline path selected by daily baseline discipline | PASS | Current run stem is `wasm-footprint`; baseline path resolves to `N/A`. |
| Size deltas versus baseline recorded when baseline exists | PARTIAL | First run of day; baseline deltas are \`N/A\`. |
| Verification readout captured | PASS | Command outcomes are recorded in the Verification Readout section. |

## Comparison to Previous Relevant Run

- First run of day for `wasm-footprint`; this report establishes the daily baseline.
- Baseline drift values are `N/A` until a same-day rerun or later comparable run exists.

## Structural Hotspots

| Canister | Kind | Current hotspot | Retained size | Reason | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `root` | bundle-canister | `data[0]` | 12308147 | bundle-canister outlier; embeds child .wasm.gz artifacts and must not be compared directly to leaf peers | [root.md](artifacts/wasm-footprint/root.md) |

## Dependency Fan-In Pressure

- `minimal` remains the shared-runtime floor. If `minimal` stays close to feature canisters, size pressure is coming from shared crates rather than role-specific logic.
- `root` is always interpreted as a bundle canister because it embeds child `.wasm.gz` artifacts during build.
- Large retained hotspots that repeat across many per-canister detail reports should be treated as shared fan-in pressure in crates such as `canic-core`, DTO/serialization glue, logging, metrics, auth, and lifecycle/runtime support.

## Early Warning Signals

| Signal | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimal floor close to feature canisters | OK | `minimal` shrunk wasm = N/A, `app` shrunk wasm = N/A. |
| Root bundle outlier | WARN | `root` shrunk wasm = 10262971. |
| Shrink delta unexpectedly low | WARN | `minimal` shrink delta = N/A bytes. |

## Per-Canister Snapshot

| Canister | Kind | Built wasm | Shrunk wasm | Shrink delta | Built gz | Shrunk gz | Baseline delta | Built funcs | Shrunk funcs | Exports | Detail |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `root` | bundle-canister | 15606460 | 10262971 | 5343489 | 13103938 | 7763782 | N/A | 6005 | 6005 | 54 | [root.md](artifacts/wasm-footprint/root.md) |

## Risk Score

Risk Score: **3 / 10**

Interpretation: this is a wasm drift score, not a correctness score. The main drivers in Canic are the shared runtime floor across leaf canisters and the special-case bundle behavior in `root`.

## Verification Readout

| Command | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown ... && dfx build ...` | PASS | built and cached raw/shrunk artifacts for cargo/dfx release builds |
| `ic-wasm <artifact> info` | PASS | structure snapshots captured for built and shrunk artifacts |
| `twiggy top|dominators|monos <analysis.wasm>` | PASS | twiggy artifacts captured for each canister in scope |
| `baseline size-metrics.tsv comparison` | BLOCKED | first run of day; no baseline comparison available |

## Follow-up Actions

1. Owner boundary: `shared runtime baseline`
   Action: compare `minimal` retained hotspots against one feature canister in the next run and treat overlapping drivers as shared-cost reduction candidates.
   Target report date/run: `docs/audits/reports/2026-03/2026-03-28/wasm-footprint.md`
2. Owner boundary: `bundle canister root`
   Action: keep tracking `root` separately from leaf canisters so child bundle growth and root-local growth do not get conflated.
   Target report date/run: `docs/audits/reports/2026-03/2026-03-28/wasm-footprint.md`
