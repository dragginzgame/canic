# Fleet Funding Operations

This runbook covers the maintained 0.108 funding paths for an installed Canic
Fleet. The Fleet Coordinator normally funds current Fleet Subnet Roots. Direct
cycle top-up and Root-owned ICP conversion are explicit recovery actions.

## Observe Before Acting

Read the Coordinator and every current Root through authenticated installed-
Fleet authority:

~~~text
canic cycles funding <fleet>
canic cycles funding <fleet> --json
~~~

The report identifies the exact Coordinator and Root Principals and shows:

- Coordinator balance, funding enablement, protected profile, minimum reserve,
  rolling spend plus outstanding reservations, and non-renewing automatic caps;
- each Root lifecycle state, live balance, funding eligibility, protected
  request/target policy, current operation and last Coordinator result;
- manual/automatic ICP policy, cumulative ICP use and the latest refill result;
  and
- Fiduciary placement acknowledgement and retained high-cost warnings.

Automatic funding is the normal path. Do not start a competing recovery action
while a Root reports `pending=true` or a refill reports `recovery_required`.
First reconcile the existing operation under the
[recovery and retry runbooks](recovery-retry-runbooks.md).

## Direct Cycle Top-Up

Direct top-up is the break-glass path when the Coordinator or a Root needs
cycles immediately. Preview the exact authenticated target before the live
call:

~~~text
canic cycles topup <fleet> coordinator <amount> --dry-run
canic cycles topup <fleet> <root-principal> <amount> --dry-run
~~~

Then remove `--dry-run` to execute the reviewed command. There is no `root`
alias: a Root target must be one explicit current, non-Removed Fleet Subnet Root
Principal from `canic cycles funding`.

A direct top-up changes only the canister balance. It does not reset rolling
windows, cooldowns, reserved spend, or non-renewing grant/refill caps. Re-run
`canic cycles funding <fleet>` afterward and allow the retained operation, if
any, to reach a terminal state before initiating other funding work.

## Manual Root ICP Conversion

Use manual conversion only when the selected Root has protected ICP-refill
authority and sufficient ICP for the requested amount, the ledger fee and its
configured minimum retained balance. Preview first:

~~~text
canic cycles convert <fleet> <root-principal> --icp-e8s <amount> --dry-run
~~~

Then remove `--dry-run` to execute it. The Root Principal is both the protected
source owner and the cycles recipient. Optional `--from-subaccount <hex64>` and
`--operation-id <hex64>` arguments remain bound to that exact request.

The CLI writes a generated live operation identity to
`.canic/operations/pending.json` before sending. If the command is interrupted
or reports a resumable result, repeat the exact same command from the same ICP
project root, environment, Fleet, Root, subaccount and amount. The pending log
reuses the original identity. Do not delete or edit it, choose a fresh identity,
or start an automatic/manual competitor while the ledger transfer or CMC notify
outcome is uncertain. Follow the
[pending-refill and recovery-required procedures](recovery-retry-runbooks.md#icp-project-root-pending-icp-refill).

Each Root retains at most 4,096 lifetime ICP-refill operation identities so a
delayed replay can never become a new transfer. Terminal identities are not
evicted. If status reports the capacity limit, exact replay of retained work
remains valid but a new conversion fails closed; use direct cycle top-up and
plan a fresh reinstall rather than deleting replay evidence.

## Refusals And Lifecycle Fences

- Funding-disabled Coordinator or Root state is an intentional kill switch.
  Direct top-up may restore balance, but it does not re-enable policy.
- Removed Roots are never valid targets. A Draining Root is eligible only
  before the one lifecycle-owned funding fence and only while exact unfinished
  funded teardown work remains. At or after that fence no new automatic work
  may begin; retained same-operation recovery must settle before removal.
- Rolling-window, cooldown and non-renewing cap exhaustion is fail-closed. Wait
  only for a renewable window/cooldown. A non-renewing cap requires a new
  reinstall-time protected policy; do not edit installed authority.
- Automatic ICP refill is a terminal emergency fallback, not a parallel funding
  source. It can start only after Coordinator funding cannot restore a Root at
  or below its protected emergency threshold.
- Per-call/cumulative ICP caps, minimum retained ICP, ledger fee, conversion
  rate floor and exact-target checks refuse the refill before an unsafe value
  transfer. Use direct cycle top-up for immediate recovery or correct policy in
  a fresh reinstall; pre-1.0 releases do not migrate installed authority.
- A Fiduciary placement warning is retained evidence of higher-cost authority,
  not a runtime override. Confirm that its exact acknowledgement matches the
  installed plan before funding the Fleet.

After any recovery, run both text and JSON status as needed, confirm there is no
unresolved current operation, and retain the terminal receipt for the incident
record.
