# Changelog

All notable, and occasionally less notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
- Changed: Shard helpers now use `CanisterType` instead of pool name.
  - `assign_in_pool(hub_type, canister_type, item)`
  - `plan_pool(hub_type, canister_type, item)`
  - `ensure_item_assignment_from_pool(hub_type, canister_type, item)`
  - Pools are resolved by matching `canister_type` in config; Player Hub call sites remain valid.
- DX: Pre-commit hook auto-formats (`cargo fmt`) and sorts (`cargo sort`, `cargo sort-derives`), then stages changes.
- CI: Add workflow `permissions` and `concurrency`; use `make fmt-check` and `make clippy` for consistency.
- Makefile: `install-dev` installs `cargo-sort` and `cargo-sort-derives` to support hooks locally.
- Scripts: Fix `scripts/app/version.sh` usage to remove non-implemented `release` subcommand.
