//!
//! xxHash3 hashing utilities.
//!
//! These functions provide **fast, deterministic, non-cryptographic hashes**
//! that work reliably on the Internet Computer.
//!
//! They are used across both **canic** (runtime layer) and **mimic**
//! (framework layer) for tasks that require uniform and reproducible hashing
//! such as:
//!   - routing / sharding decisions,
//!   - cache keys or internal identifiers,
//!   - stable yet non-secure fingerprinting of data.
//!
//! ✅ Extremely fast (optimized for 64-bit architectures)
//! ✅ Deterministic across replicas and platforms
//! ⚠️ Not cryptographically secure — do not use for signatures or certified data
//!
