Interface

- Purpose: Low-level canister interfaces and raw IC/NNS/SNS interactions.
- Scope: Define request/response types and thin wrappers over canister calls.
- Stability: Keep types and candid compatibility stable; document breaking changes.
- Tip: Avoid business logic; keep this layer minimal and testable.
