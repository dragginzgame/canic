# Canic M0 management-effect experiments

These installed PocketIC experiments ask whether the management owner can retain
creation, funding and artifact evidence across traps and owner upgrades. They use
the published Platform runtime and real local management calls. These are
qualification fixtures, not a deployable Canic runtime or the M1 Hello World CLI.

From the repository root, after the normal development tool preparation:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.100.0
cargo fetch --locked --manifest-path qualification/Cargo.toml
make m0-setup
make m0-test
```

`m0-setup` explicitly provisions Testkit's authenticated PocketIC 16.1.0 bundle
under `target/m0/server`. Tests only check that prepared bundle; they never
download a server. An already prepared bundle can be selected with
`IC_TESTKIT_SERVER_DIRECTORY=/absolute/path make m0-test`. Tests need permission
to bind a local loopback port. They create isolated local instances, use synthetic
cycles, and close each instance after its case. No mainnet endpoint or signer is
configured.

The runner builds the probe and selects its Wasm from Cargo artifact messages.
It first checks that maximum retained evidence fits the Wire status contract,
then runs five installed creation scenarios:

| Scenario | Observation required |
| --- | --- |
| Trap after enqueue, before dispatch commit | No new canister; intent and reservation roll back |
| Trap before recording the returned principal | One new canister; committed intent remains without a retained principal; another attempt is blocked |
| Write principal, then trap in the same callback | Same uncertainty as the preceding case: the write was not a commit |
| Commit principal, then trap in a separate self-call | Principal and original outcome survive; replay returns that evidence without creating another child |
| No injected fault | Creation evidence and controller assignment are retained; replay has no creation effect |

Each executor admits at most one creation and attaches 2 trillion synthetic
cycles. The harness bootstraps it with PocketIC's default 100 trillion cycles.
The reported executor balance decrease includes transferred cycles and execution
charges; it is not a measurement of consumed cost alone or a mainnet quote.
Uncertain attempts retain their full attachment as exposure and cannot reset it.

PocketIC subnet counts and controller inspection are independent test oracles.
They are not supplied to the executor to reconstruct a lost result. A child can
exist while its principal is absent from the executor's committed evidence.
The fixture deliberately demonstrates that blocked window rather than guessing
the principal or automatically retrying.

The funding experiment repeats the five interruption windows for both an empty
live recipient and a deleted recipient on the same subnet. The latter produces
a management rejection and refunds the attachment. Each fresh executor admits
one deposit of at most 1 trillion synthetic cycles, retaining the destination,
amount and exact management request. Successful callbacks retain completion with
zero refund; rejecting callbacks retain their raw reject code and matching refund.
Any unrefunded rejection exposure stays reserved. A retained result is returned
on identical replay; an uncertain attempt stays blocked. Changed destinations
or amounts cannot overwrite either slot state, including a fully refunded rejection.

Independent recipient balances prove whether a second credit occurred. Executor
balance changes help check physical refunds, but neither balance is accepted by
the probe as operation evidence. A lost callback stays blocked even when the
harness can see the transfer or refund. Separate admission cases check zero and
excessive amounts, malformed principals and unauthorized callers, followed by a
valid deposit to prove invalid commands did not consume the slot. Creation and
funding use independent test slots; this is not a shared product allowance policy.

The maintenance rehearsal uses two different executables with the same journal
format. It captures both journals outside the executor, stops it, injects a trap
after the candidate restores and writes stable memory, and restarts the surviving
executable. It then performs a successful upgrade and repeats the failure with
populated stable memory. Module identity, controller graph and exact journals
must survive each failed upgrade; the successful upgrade must select the changed
executable without resetting outstanding exposure. Replaying commands must create
no extra child or deposit. Cases cover an empty slot, retained successes, a
retained rejection/refund, lost callback evidence and failure in later work.
An unauthorized principal must be unable to upgrade the executor.

Run just that rehearsal with `make m0-maintenance-test`. `make m0-test` includes
it alongside the creation/funding boundary cases. The runner builds both Wasms
and saves their separate inputs under `target/m0/` before executing the tests.
The checkpoint stores each journal in its existing bounded Wire frame, using
one 64 KiB stable page through Platform Runtime. This isolated test owns that
raw backing; it does not qualify a production `ic-storage` integration. Existing
heap-only probes are not upgrade inputs: the harness installs fresh executors.

These cases qualify a maintenance window after message executions have settled,
including uncertain effects left by failed callbacks. They do not qualify
upgrading with callbacks in flight, schema migration, unconditionally trapping
pre-upgrade hooks, host crash recovery, governance, ledger-based funding, artifact
availability during operator absence or mainnet executor maintenance. The host
harness retains observations in memory, not a durable operator journal. Those
remain separate proofs. The continuation is an actual self-call; an ordinary
Rust-only `await` is not a commit boundary.

## Artifact custody without the operator

Run `make m0-artifact-test` after the same preparation. This separate fixture
keeps the preceding creation/funding probe unchanged. It builds the actual Hello
World worker and two executor executables from Cargo artifact records. The
controller approves one exact target, uncompressed Wasm hash, retained module,
dispatch time and interruption mode; invalid hashes, oversized uploads and
unauthorized callers cannot consume the slot. An admitted approval cannot be
replaced, even after a rejection or unknown outcome.

The executor survives a failed upgrade and a successful upgrade before dispatch.
With no subsequent operator command, a test-only heartbeat uploads the retained
bytes to its own IC-managed chunk store and calls `install_chunked_code` on an
existing empty worker. The released Platform 0.32.2 `InstallCodeArgs` is
native-only; this fixture qualifies the available on-chain chunked API. It uses
one chunk and adds no Store canister. Direct host installation remains the M1
baseline; this is not a second product deployment engine.

Four installed cases cover success, a lost upload callback, a lost installation
callback and refusal to install over existing code. A later executor upgrade
must preserve the original request commitments and attempt counts. A lost upload
callback remains blocked, even when the test oracle can see the stored chunk.
A lost install callback can be reconciled through the management API's module
hash and sole-controller evidence, without reinstalling or claiming that the
original callback was retained. Worker canister versions independently check
that rejected installs and repeated approvals did not replace code again.

The fixture limits artifacts to 64 KiB. Its checkpoint owns raw stable backing
only within this experiment; the provider chunk store is separately measured.
Neither proves production Storage integration, a production scheduling policy,
multi-chunk handling, chunk cleanup, callback-in-flight upgrades, application
readiness or a mainnet cost estimate. The worker is pre-created by the harness;
combining creation and installation into the product path remains M2 work. The
first team-facing multi-canister demo still requires the planned fleet view.

Focused checks are `make m0-artifact-clippy` and `make m0-artifact-doc`.
The aggregate `make ci` includes the artifact experiment separately from
`make m0-test`.

## Checks and evidence

Focused checks are `make m0-clippy`, `make m0-doc`, `make fmt-check` and
`make toko-tooling-check`. The aggregate `make ci` includes the fixture and
requires prior `m0-setup`; it does not install tools. Qualification packages have
their own catalog and lockfile, with no dependency from the product workspace.
Build output lives in `qualification/target`; root `target/m0` holds preparation
and Cargo artifact records.

The [M0 record](../docs/design/m0-first-journey.md) reports observed results and
remaining decisions. Passing this experiment does not complete M0 or establish
general effect recovery. Local dispatch-resource failures, cross-subnet funding
and production approval of blocked exposure remain unqualified.
